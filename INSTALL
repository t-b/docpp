The steps in order to compile this package are:
  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system. If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile. While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

     The `configure' script is generated from `configure.in' by GNU's autoconf
     and it attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent
     variables used during compilation. It also creates the Makefiles needed to
     compile the package and a `.h' file containing system-dependent
     definitions;

  2. Type `make' to compile the package;

  3. Type `make install' to install the package. This operation should be done
     logged on as root;

  4. You can remove the object files from the source directory by typing
     `make clean'. To also remove the files that `configure' created
     (so you can compile the package for a different kind of system), type
     `make distclean';

  5. Type `make uninstall' to remove the package from the destination
     directories.

Installation directories
    By default, `make install' will install the package's binaries in
    `/usr/bin'. You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr'
    by giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

Other features and options
    --enable-debug to enable generation of debugging informations.
    For other options, type `./configure --help'.

Hope you have already read the `README' file.
