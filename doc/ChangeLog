   - Spent today struggling with java, it seems to be a little broken. The
     different results from parsing the java sourcetree backwards & forewards
     were due to bracket miscounting / poison sources.
   - Major flex change in java.l
   - Killed most general rules, they are the devils tool :-)
     /* This bracket doesnt matter now { */
   - Added a string / char state to handle:
     char a = '{' ;
     String b = new String ("/** Hello") ;
   - Spent a while hunting and fixing:
     /* Isn't it nasty when you start a char initialiser on your isn't */
     char a = '\'' ;
   - Added support for C++ style comments ie. '//'
   - Fixed trivial bug in name of HIERjava file I had introduced.
   - Onwards with getting the '-J' : Javadoc compatibility flag a bit neater.

1998/08/14
   - Added macro 'worthDoing' to findSub such that only the names of entries
     with section CLASS_SEC | UNION_SEC | PACKAGE_SEC | INTERFACE_SEC are
     searched.
   - Fixed bug in environment variable handling, was missing the last argument
   - Removed 'dmsg' routine and calls from cpp.yy, perhaps this'll accelerate
     parsing.
   - Fixed the cache from yesterday, now names are copied into the cache.
   - Turned Gif generation off by default ( this never worked for me )
   - Started looking at the problems my mods have caused Java
   - Added a hash of java keywords
   - Re-wrote my list / sorting mods to deal with heirarchical package display.
   - Noticed the java stuff is somewhat suboptimal, the -J flag doesn't do a
     good job of javadoc compatibility. Will spend time on this.
   - Noticed wierdness with reversing the (originaly alphabetic) order of
     arguments when in java mode, this gets things 'Well wrong' TM.
     Perhaps this is due to some cunningness I've just noticed in findSub that
     assumes they are sorted ? ...

1998/08/13-Evening
   - Tried to test the doc++ automatic manual generation with no success :-(
   - Fixed a bug I'd introduced fixing the fix to a bug I thought I'd
     fixed. Now I hope both array initialisations, and plain numeric ones
     work ( they seem to )
        int variable[]= { 1, 2, 3 };
        int numeric = 3 ;
   - Fixed bug in finding comments after semi-colons, would swallow the 'c'
     in char:
        void function();char anotherfunction();
   - Very slow building list, so implemented several speedups in makeHtml
     and Entry.cpp::getRefEntry.
   - Removed bad speedup in findStubs from yesterday.
   - Changed StrToHtml to check for a null string sent to it before jumping
     into reams of flex.
   - Changed StrToHtml's arguments to take a refence to a McString for rapid
     checking of string lengths.
   - Attacked getRefEntry, examined its typical arguments, and discovered most
     of them were reserved words.
   - Implemented fast McHashTable to quickly remove these without a
     long-winded search.
   - Added a cache of the last few names looked up and whether they were
     found, this catches a large proportion of lookups.
   - Added a check against 'General' entries, these shouldn't have links to
     them anyway as they don't have their own page, their page is huge, and
     there are so few real references versus a huge number of bogus finds.
     This approx. doubled the speed of the doc++ run, from 20->11 secs.

1998/08/13
   - Overhauled the argument parsing bits, now using a McDArray of char*
   - Added support for arguments in the environment variable 'DOC'
   - Noted that readfile's directory handling looks nasty, but is prob.
     too fragile to play with.
   - Profiled code, little success but added a cache that accelerates half
     of findSubs.
   - Removed loads of debugging guff that was coming out all over the place

1998/08/12
   - Made type names appear in General.html, strangely they wern't
   - Fixed stupid flex error, in handling bit widths.
   - Updated index output, such that methods with the same name and class
     are merged, before emitting the duplicate method class list ( in some
     cases this removes the need for one ).
   - Fixed support for whitespace after a #define line continuation eg:
        #define A this_is_line_1 \      \n
        this_is_line2

1998/08/11
   - Discovered several bugs I had introduced thinking I was fixing things
     eg. Array initialisation and removed them. 
   - Fixed / extended syntax to remove altogether statements of the form:
        extern any_declaration (newlines?) ("C") { } ;
   - Fixed bit width specifiers, although this will probably break all other
     name parsing in a subtle way:
        int register_a : 2;
   - Removed limit of 200 characters in 'myOpen' that had escaped me.
   - Fixed loss of type in:
        int a, b, c
     Now we get 'int a', 'int b' ... in the output instead of 'int a', 'b', ...
   - Fixed bug in code I added to search for comments after #defines, since
     I'm not interested in defines removed this.
   - Fixed so that whitespace after a protection declaration works eg.
        private   :
   - Created an extra flex state to remove trailing semicolons after braces
     without generating a blank entry. eg.
        void method() { printf ("Foo") ; };
   - Implemented duplicate resolution in the index, and revised the index
     output system. Now duplicates get a seperate sub list, with a heading of
     the method name, and the class names as links. This still produces odd
     results with lots of overloaded constructors.
   - Added a fast command line parameter, that sacrifices memory re /
     de-allocation for speed.

1998/08/10
   - Spent all morning chasing obscure buffer overflow, caused by some
     'extern' nastiness in the flex ( I think ), anyway resovled to
     erradicate all arbitary buffer sizes...
   - Added large memory saving, of truncating McDArrays ( as used in all
     strings ) to a length of 1 ( carriage null ) when they are cleared
     as opposed to wasting that memory.
   - Today I realised that August is the 8th month.

1998/07/07
   - A big tar-ball of dirty sources ... I am using / testing:
        doc++ -g -l -d html -p -A -c -q <filenames>

1998/07/06
   - A new patch, this time adding support for simple post method comments
     in class instances ie.
        void method(int an_arg) ; // Hello there
     Will be commented with 'Hello There', this means a load of legacy
     comments can be used without conversion.
   - Forward class declarations eg.
        // Declared lower down
        class cForwardClass;
     are now ignored.
   - A new file 'General.html' is being generated which in future will hold
     all the bits we don't know much about eg. '#defines', global variables,
     constants etc.

1998/07/05
   - First patch against version 3.2. This is very alpha code, implementing
     the Quantel extensions for folding comments, and fixing the odd mis-feature.

1998/07/04
   - Put up small list of improvements / un-understood bits to start on
     after code read.

1998/07/03
   - Started code reading and noting bugs as yet uncovered to fix. First
     stop -Wall
