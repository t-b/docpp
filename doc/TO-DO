DOC++ v3.4.x
December 22, 2002
TO-DO: Future development ideas

BUG FIXES:

- correct sorting for Java graphs and for TeX output
  (Knut Stolze <stolze@informatik.uni-jena.de>)

- fix that errors reported by weblint on generated HTML pages (partially done)

CHANGES:
- sort out XML/DocBook output (partially done)

- sort out PHP parsing

- get `equate' working

- warning should contain a reference to the file and line number where it
  occured (partially done)
  (Peer Sommerlund <peer.sommerlund@netman.dk>)

- optionally disable the merging mechanism
  (Peer Sommerlund <peer.sommerlund@netman.dk>)

FEATURES:
- specify where to look for #included header files
  (Peer Sommerlund <peer.sommerlund@netman.dk>)

- formatting of internal types (for example `{\tt...}' for TeX output)
  (Holger Flvrke <hf@daisybytes.com>)

- support `using' keyword

- man, SGML, XML, info output

- make use of STL

- use DOC++ to produce annotated source code listings - DOC++ comments would
  be typeset, while code lines would be numbered and inserted verbatim into
  the document. Ideally, hyperlinks would be made between member function
  descriptions in the class hierarchy documents, and the actual commented code
  listing
  (Jonathan Rice <rice@squareusa.com>)

- Include all of the source files, cross linked, 
  syntax coloured ( in HTML ), with bold comments.

- Add object instance type checking and scoping to languages so
  method source can be traced through dereferenced objects in source.

- Abstract to pluggable module for editors / IDEs

- Expand to C, PASCAL using a filename based heuristic for
  generating links, with a struct based type checking / cross-linking
  system.
